	    <p>As part of my master’s degree in composition, which I am currently pursuing at the University of Toronto, I	am working with a few other graduate students co-composing an opera on Michael Albano’s comedic libretto “Who Killed Adriana”. It will be premiered fully staged with orchestra by the U of T opera program in the new year. I am responsible for composing the overture, a portion of the opening scene, and the final scene.</p>
