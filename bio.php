   <p>Tristan Zaba is a musician prone to flights of experimentation"(Mark Anthony Brennan, ridethetempo.com), testing the preconceptions of various genres and disciplines. With the intent of engaging and challenging both audiences and fellow musicians in a meaningful way, Tristan seeks to employ experimentalism within a broader cultural context and has been compared to Frank Zappa by Doug Kretchmer of Community News Commons.</p>
